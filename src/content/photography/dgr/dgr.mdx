Not long after I arrived in Australia, I bought myself a motorbike, I wasn't planning on it, but I hadn't written it off either! So I did, and only a few days later after getting all set up, I realised that the DGR was happening and I decided to go looking for them. 

Well I cought up and thankfully I brought my trusty old XT1 with me and got shooting. Was fun, I've never particiaped again mind you, maybe I will this year. 

Check out some of the pictures below :)
