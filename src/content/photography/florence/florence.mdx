My partner Kimmy's favorite place in the whole world is absolutely, without a doubt, Florence. She had lived there for a number of years before we met, but she had always desired to live there again, even if it was just for a few months. So that's what we did, and it was amazing. I just wish I had attempted to learn some Italian beforehand. We have actually stayed a few times since, and would love to buy a place there one day.

While we were there, these are some of the shots I had taken along the way.
