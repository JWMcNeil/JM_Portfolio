Back in 2015, I took the plunge and jumped on a plane bound for Australia. 
I was supposed to go with my best friend Tiffy, but he bailed (thanks mateâ€¦) No hard feelings though, as I think the experience of traveling solo was a challenging - but rewarding one!

When I first arrived in Oz, my plan was to travel as a backpacker, jumping on the greyhound buses, carpooling, or whatever. 
Needless to say, that never happened, as the itch to ride was even greater, especially once you marvel at the number of bikes in use here! 
After only a short search, I stumbled upon an advert for a 2006 Suzuki V-Strom 650cc, a poor man's adventure bike as I called it. 
So with my suitcase literally strapped to the back pillion seat, I was off, and these are some of the pictures I had taken along the way.

<Image src={SydneyRoad} alt="Dark road, just off Sydney Road" />

I have a collection of photos from a trip to the outback, that was weird as fuck tbh, I'll link that in another post.

<Image src={VW} alt="VW Camper" />
<Image src={Suz} alt="Suzuki DL650 V-Strom, Jamie Bike whilst travelling" />
<Image src={Wentworth} alt="Jamie posing at Wentworth Falls" />

There are many many more, but this will do for now!
