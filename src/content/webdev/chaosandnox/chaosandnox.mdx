**Chaos and Nox** is another big project of ours, being myself, my partner Kim and her brother David.

We've been sitting on this idea for years, which is large in scale, so I won't go through all the details here, as this is a post about the website after all...

It will be a content driven website but with some big aspects needed to be built, such as a store, blog, donation page, member access. So a lot to learn on my part as I've already made my mind up that I will build it. 

I've got hundreds of GB's, over multiple computers, drives which is just utter chaos (get it?...) that I need to work on before I can share some ideas, designs and thoughts on how to tackle such a huge project.
