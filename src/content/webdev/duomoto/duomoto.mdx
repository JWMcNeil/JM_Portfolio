This one is exciting, for me as a motorcyclist enthusiast, I've always dreamed of having a motorcycle blog/ channel that allows me to review, test and document travel via two wheels! 

The idea is more than that though, I'm building this in partnership with my partners brother and good friend David. We plan on purchising older bikes, pre-loved or straight up bikes that have been flogged their entire life, and then review and flip them for a profit. Sounds easy right? I'm sure it is....

As for the website, it's purely a design at this point, I did  begin building this in Astro, but I'm very tempted to try writing it in Sveltekit. Honestly, I find it hard to stray from Astro, as I enjoy it to much, that being said, I can utilise svelte components in Astro if I so choose too.
