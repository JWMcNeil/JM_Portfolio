This project was from awhile ago, but still one that I enjoyed enough to showcase here. 

This was actually the first project where we had an excuse to go and buy a drone, so maybe that is why I liked it! We were tasked to film about the famous painter **Alfred William Eustace**, out on location in Chiltern, Vic. This is where William would paint on the leaves of white box trees and the like. Iâ€™m stretching my memory but it was a fun and interesting project, check it out below.
